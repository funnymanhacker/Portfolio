        <p class="card-text">Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.<span id="s3">...</span><span id="d3"> Built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome, Node.js enables the creation of scalable and high-performance applications, particularly for web servers and real-time applications. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it efficient for handling multiple connections simultaneously, making it ideal for data-intensive, real-time applications.
          Node.js uses a package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), which provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules, simplifying the development process. It supports various frameworks, such as Express.js, that enhance its capabilities for building web applications. With its ability to utilize JavaScript across both client and server sides, Node.js fosters a unified development environment</span></p>

        <p class="card-text">C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that extends the C programming language by adding object-oriented features.<span id="s4">...</span><span id="d4"> Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms, allowing for flexible and reusable code. It introduces concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which enable developers to create complex systems efficiently.
          C++ is widely used in system/software development, game development, real-time simulation, and performance-critical applications due to its ability to manage low-level memory and system resources. Its performance and efficiency make it a favored choice for developing applications where speed and resource management are crucial.</span></p>
